**Project Goal & Analysis (What I'm showing & Why):** 
There is a lot of  surrounding who the best NBA players are and I wanted to take the raw data, peform ETL, to eventually anaylze and visualize it. From there I wanted to show visualizations with the data and my main interest was to see if career average points was the deciding factor in determining the ranks of the players. I was able to make a conclusion through the bar chart that will be displayed in the code.

**API documentation:** 
N/A as no API was used;
Libraries used: BeautifulSoup (to read and parse raw data), Pandas (to read csv), Matplotlib (to plot diagrams)

**The license of data and any source data:**

**Data Type and Description for Each Attribute in Data:**

**Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection:**
As mentioned above, there is a lot of controversy surrounding who people think the best NBA players are, however I cannot find any places of bias as this data is simply used to give out information about each of the top players. The only possibility I can think of is their overall rankings and how people may disagree with them as they have not described what the deciding factor of the ranks were (especially when statistics were very similar).
